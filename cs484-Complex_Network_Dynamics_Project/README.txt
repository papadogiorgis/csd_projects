To run this project;
    1. Go to src folder
    2. Open each of the notebooks with this order;
        preliminary_analysis.ipynb
        phase_a.ipynb
        phase_b.ipynb
        phase_c.ipynb
    -> Keep in mind that the Analysis Phases of MY project are different from the project phases A and B of this subject.
    -> I have divided my Analysis into three phases to keep my analysis organized.
    3. Choose the base kernel (Python 3.13.5 (or another version))
    4. Run all cells
    5. The plots will be saved in project484_4975/plots folder (if this folder doesnt exist,
        it will be created while you compile any notebook)
    6. I have a folder called projects484_4975/myplots from my own compilation of the notebooks, if you do not want to wait
        the notebooks to be compiled. (takes about 10 minutes total (depends on the system))

Code Structure;
    Analysis is done using the notebooks, where every plot and result is stored.
    The functions that these notebooks call are implemented in other python files (.py files, not .ipynb files),
    that anyone can access in project484_4975/src folder. Specifically, the .py files are;
        1. src/clean.py (used in every notebook)
        2. src/preliminary_analysis_functions.py (used in preliminary_analysis.ipynb)
        2. src/phase_a_functions.py (used in phase_a.ipynb)
        2. src/phase_b_functions.py (used in phase_b.ipynb)
        2. src/phase_c_functions.py (used in phase_c.ipynb)
