# CS255 Systems Programming Lab

## Assignment 1: "Translate" Program
It's a program that translates characters from iso8859-7 (greek characters) to iso8859-1 (latin characters).

## Assignment 2: A String Module
Using the C programming language I implement the "MyString" module, which includes custom implementations of the most commonly used string functions, mimicking the behavior of their standard C counterparts.

## Assignment 3: Symbol Table
I implement a generic abstract data type (ADT) called SymTable, with two versions: one using a linked list and one using a hash table.

## Assignment 4: Sudoku checker, solver, and generator
I implement a C program, called "sudoku", that uses grid.h and sudoku.h to solve, check, or generate Sudoku puzzles via command-line options.
