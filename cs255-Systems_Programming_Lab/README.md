## Assignment 1: "Translate" Program
It's a program that translates characters from iso8859-7 (greek characters) to iso8859-1 (latin characters).

## Assignment 2: A String Module
This assignment requires you to use the C programming language to implement the "MyString" module, which includes custom implementations of the most commonly used string functions, mimicking the behavior of their standard C counterparts.

## Assignment 3: Symbol Table
This assignment requires you to implement a generic abstract data type (ADT) called SymTable, with two versions: one using a linked list and one using a hash table.
